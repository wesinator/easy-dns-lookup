# Easy DNS

A web browser addon to do DNS lookups in the browser.

Available for Firefox here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/easy-dns-lookup/

#### Notes and known issues:
 - Some DNS-over-HTTPS servers don't have an [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSMissingAllowOrigin) response header, preventing the response from loading.
 - The Google DNS option uses Google's `/resolve` endpoint, which may have slightly different formatting than other servers.
